# 🕒 Clock Divider by 4

A digital design project that implements a **Clock Divider by 4** using Verilog HDL.  
This project demonstrates how a high-frequency clock signal can be divided into a lower-frequency output clock.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Design and implement a Clock Divider by 4 circuit.
- Understand frequency division using sequential logic.
- Simulate and verify the output waveform.
- Gain practical knowledge in Verilog and digital circuit design.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

A Clock Divider by 4 reduces the input clock frequency to one-fourth of its original value.
If input clock frequency = **F**  
Output clock frequency = **F / 4**

This is implemented using:
  - Flip-flops or counter-based logic.
  - Sequential circuit design.
  - Edge-triggered clock mechanism.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Verilog HDL
- EDAPlayground (Online Simulator)
- Waveform Viewer (Icarus Verilog 12.0)


## 📊 Expected Output

- The output clock toggles once for every four input clock cycles.
- Verified using waveform simulation.
